# Project for React Testing Course

## Description

The main objective of this project is to provide a practical environment for learning and applying testing techniques in React using react-testing-library.

Key features that will be used for testing demonstrations include:

- User authentication
- Global state management
- API calls (simulated with json-server)
- Conditional rendering and error handling

Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in writing effective tests, using mocks, and simulating user interactions, all within the context of a real and functional React application.

## Main Features

- User authentication
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Mock API with json-server for local development
